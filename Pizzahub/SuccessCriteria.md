**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Construct a properly structured HTML document, including a proper DOCTYPE, character-encoding META tag, and a lang attribute on the HTML start tag.
2. Structure the page with appropriate page-level sectioning elements (header, main and footer) to construct the main document outline.
3. Think of the various pieces of information that you'd need to collect from someone to deliver them a pizza. This might include the following:
    1. Number of pizzas
    2. Size (number of slices)
    3. Shape (square or round)
    4. Toppings
    5. Deep dish, thin crust or some other crust types
    6. Take out, delivery, or eat-in g. And so on…
4. Build a FORM that would allow a visitor to order their pizza(s), including a variety of form controls such as:
    1. labels
    2. fieldsets/legends
    3. text boxes
    4. select menus
    5. radio buttons
    6. checkboxes
    7. text areas
    8. submit/reset buttons
    9. …and any others that you feel make sense.
5. Include at least one \<img /\> element to insert a relevant illustration or photograph inside a paragraph in the page with an alt attribute. Ensure that the type of file is appropriate to the image (.jpg for a photograph, .png or .gif for an illustration/graphic).
6. Include helpful HTML comments to make the code more friendly and easy to maintain. Ensure that your code is also formatted appropriately.
7. Have fun.

**TAKE IT FURTHER**

- Upload your FORM and any image(s) to a web server.
- Consider some more specific FORM elements like:

  - phone
  - email
  - numerical input
  - date
  - option groups
  - color
  - range
  - meter
  - progress
- Capture some of the user form input and output it to another page to confirm the user's order.
- Anything else you can think of…
